## React-Portfolio
![](React.png)
## Description
As an aspiring web-developer / programmer / dev. It is everyone's dream to land a dev job coming out of a bootcamp. Thanks to this bootcamp, that dream has already become a reality. I have landed a position as a back-end automation tester / jr dev for a local cyber-security company.

Likewise, as a result. I had to power thru this assignment as quickly as possible as I am following behind with real work. React is a wonderful library and utility that allows dev's to organize their cards and objects in a much more manageable fashion. It is incredibly powerful at displaying and organizing functionality for high-end usage.
